                Ranobe-Honyaku is a fan translation community that facilitates the hosting of light novels being translated. </br> </br>
                It's done differently to the only other community based platform (that I know of), Baka-Tsuki as it's not done in the style of a wiki.
                Founded in 2016 by Recchan after thinking MediaWiki was outdated. The site is built upon bulma.css and Python's micro-framework Flask using RethinkDB
                as the database. </br> </br>
                Just to be clear; this isn't a translation group. Translators/Translation groups choose to come here and independantly translate and upload their translations;
                we have no input on what is translated or in what manner they translate, nor do we have control over how fast updates occur.
